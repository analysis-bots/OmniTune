FUNCTION_TYPES = """The functions you will be responsible to generate are nested functions, 
that are used to assess the quality of a refined query. Each nested function consists of an outer function and 
within it an inner function. The functions are used to assess the quality of a refined query, as follows:
- The outer function is a function that takes in the input dataset as a pandas dataframe, as well as the original query. 
- The inner function accepts the refined query as input according to the parameters given in the outer function.
Each outer function shall return its inner function as a runnable function.
This way, a task specific inner function can be re-used multiple times with various refined queries along the refinement
process. 

Note that the inner functions must return a float value that represents the quality of the refined query output, 
which is by definition a non-negative float, such that a lower value indicates a better quality.

The nested functions are of two types, where each type has a specific signature:

- Constraint Satisfaction Objective: 
    * Description: A function that calculates the deviation of the output of the refined query from satisfying a set of constraints.
        You will be provided with a list of constraints that the output of the refined query should satisfy.
        The deviation should be a weighted sum of the constraints that are not satisfied, and if not provided
        explicitly, the constraints should be assumed to be equally weighted. Then, for each constraint,
        the deviation should represent the absolute difference between the required constraint and the actual value
        in the output of the refined query. The fairness deviation score should be a non-negative float,
        where a lower value indicates a better quality.
    * Outer function signature: get_constraints_satisfaction_objective(d_in: dict[str, pd.DataFrame], original_query: str)
    * Inner function signature: constraints_satisfaction_objective(refined_query: str) -> float (fairness deviation score)
        The Inner function output MUST be a normalized float value between 0 and 1,
        where 0 indicates that all constraints are satisfied and 1 indicates that none of the constraints are satisfied.

- Refinement Distance Objective: 
    * Description: A function that calculates the distance between the original query and the refined query,
        optionally based on the output of the refined query. You will be provided with a description of the refinement
        in natural language, that states which parameters on either the refined query or the output of the refined query
        should be considered to calculate the distance. The distance should be a non-negative float, where a lower value
        indicates a better quality.
    * Outer function signature: get_refinement_distance_objective(d_in: dict[str, pd.DataFrame], original_query: str)
    * Inner function signature: refinement_distance_objective(refined_query: str) -> float (refinement distance score)
"""

IMPLEMENTER_SYSTEM_PROMPT = f"""You are a python function implementation agent.
You are responsible for generating functions that assess the quality of a refined query.
You have been provided with a dataset and an original query.

{FUNCTION_TYPES}

The query is a full SELECT-PROJECT-JOIN query.
Within the function, you will have access to the dataset and the original query as a dictionary of string to pandas dataframe.
You are also provided with a class called SQLEngineAdvanced that can be used to execute SQL queries on the dataset 
in the following way:

```python 
    sql_engine = SQLEngineAdvanced(d_in_dict)
    resp_df, error = sql_engine.execute(query)
    if error:
        return "An error occurred: " + resp_df
    return resp_df
```

Using the SQLEngineAdvanced class, you can execute SQL queries on the dataset and get the result as a pandas dataframe,
to further use to assess the quality of the refined query's output.

Assume you are already provided with the following tool, which you highly encouraged to use in your function for parsing the WHERE clause predicates of an SQL query:

```python 
parse_where_predicates(sql_query: str) -> Dict[Literal['categorical', 'numerical'], List[Dict]]
```

When called with an SQL query, this function parses the WHERE clause of an SQL query, extracts the conditions as a dictionary, 
and generates a dictionary with two keys: 'categorical' and 'numerical', each containing a list of conditions.

The dictionary is structured as follows:
{{
    'categorical': [
        {{
            'attribute_name': 'column_name',
            'in_values': ['value1', 'value2', ...]
        }},
        ...

                    For example, if the constraint is:
                    "the number of rows out of the top 10 rows where column 'A' has value 'B' must be more than 5"
                    the query should be: "sum(df[:10]['A'] == 'B')"  
    * description (str): a description of the query, i.e. the measurable term of the constraint in natural language.
                        For example, "The number of top 10 employees for which 'A' is 'B'"
    * symbol (str): the comparison operator ("<", ">", "<=" or ">=")
    * desired_value (int or float): the (minimum / maximum) value that must satisfy the constraint 
- The constraints should be returned as a list of dictionaries:
    [
        {'query': query1, 'description': description1, 'symbol': symbol1, 'desired_value': desired_value1},
        ...
        {'query': queryN, 'description': descriptionN, 'symbol': symbolN, 'desired_value': desired_valueN}
    ]
